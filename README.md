# relaxr-practice-suite
'Relaxr' is a fictional startup that makes you relax. In this repository you will find three exercises ranging from standard markup to basic javascript.
'Relaxr-1': Copying a flat jpg using html, css, and the occasional background photo
'Relaxr-2': Using basic javascript to create drop-down/pull-up blocks of text
'Relaxr-3': Making a mobile-responsive site. Additional javascript to create pop-up modals and linking 'relaxr-1' and 'relaxr2' together.
